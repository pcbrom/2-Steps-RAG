# Classical Test Theory (CTT)) for analyzing LLM responses

## Experimental Design

This repository contains a Python script (`experimental_design.py`) that generates an experimental design plan for experiments with large language models (LLMs). 

The script creates all possible combinations of control parameters, such as `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, and `model`, and saves the plan to an Excel file (`experimental_design_plan.xlsx`). 

The Excel file includes columns for the control parameters, as well as empty columns to add prompts and results later. 

This facilitates the organization and execution of systematic experiments with LLMs, allowing for a more complete analysis of the results.
